log transaction any event which creates, views, edits, or deletes information is logged [s2]. login failures, valid authentication, and log outs are also logged [s1]. individual audit codes related to specific use cases are presented within each use case description.
note: the subflow and transaction values are based on use case. for example, any in the range of 100-199 are for use case one, any in the range of 200-299 are in use case two. the values from range 1-99 are logging events which do not exist in any use case. miscellaneous transaction codes 1-99 are presented in 5.5 below.

find lhcps for prescription renewal a patient wants to renew the patient's expired prescriptions (i.e., prescriptions' end dates are earlier than the current date) and therefore wants to find the lhcps who earlier wrote the patient's expired prescriptions (it is assumed that the doctors who wrote prescriptions are all lhcps so no lhcp checks on the prescription-writing doctors are needed). the patient chooses “my expired prescription reports” and is presented with a list of the patient's expired prescriptions [s1], sorted by start date (the later date is ranked earlier closer to the top). the patient can select to view contact information of a selected lhcp shown in the expired prescription list [s2].

report telemedicine monitoring details an lhcp or uap creates a list of patients by adding and confirming patients (by mid) for which he or she will monitor remotely [e1, s1]. a patient either chooses to input his or her physiologic measurements (blood pressure and/or glucose levels) [s2], or to input his or her weight, height, and/or pedometer readings [s7]. an lhcp can see the blood pressure and glucose levels [s3], or weight, height, and pedometer readings [s8] for the patients he or she is monitoring, with two separate lists for physiologic and height/weight/pedometer readings [s3]. a uap [s5 & s9] or patient representative [s6 & s10] can input the blood pressure, glucose levels, height, weight, or pedometer readings for a patient. a patient may have up to 10 physiologic data points in any one day, reported by him/herself, a uap, or a personal representative [e4]. a patient may have at most one height data point, one weight data point, and one pedometer data point in any one day, reported by him/herself, a uap, or a personal representative [e6].
